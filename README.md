# hey!
My name is Jessica and I'm a Web Development Junior, a Design Senior and a Media Artist by nature.
So far, my GitHub is a playground of experiments, exercises and learning material. Please don't be surprised, I told you I'm a newbie. But if you visit me more often from now on, you'll find cool projects here soon, I promise. ðŸ¤ž
