# Hey, I'm Jessica 👋

I'm a Web Developer & Technical Product Lead based in Germany.

I design and build structured digital systems, combining strategy, architecture and hands-on development.  
My background spans design, web engineering and civic tech initiatives in the public sector.

Previously, I worked as a Web Development Coach and Team Lead at [neue fische](https://www.neuefische.de/), supporting aspiring developers in building full-stack skills and technical confidence.

I care about clean architecture, thoughtful UX and translating complexity into usable digital products.
